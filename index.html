	<h1 id="top">Emu War</h1>
	<p>The Emu War, also known as the Great Emu War,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup> was a nuisance wildlife management military operation undertaken in Australia over the latter part of 1932 to address public concern over the number of emus said to be running amok in the Campion district of Western Australia. The unsuccessful attempts to curb the population of emus, a large flightless bird indigenous to Australia, employed soldiers armed with Lewis guns—leading the media to adopt the name "Emu War" when referring to the incident.</p>
	<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
	<p>Following World War I, large numbers of ex-soldiers from Australia, along with a number of British veterans, took up farming within Western Australia, often in marginal areas. With the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, these farmers were encouraged to increase their wheat crops, with the government promising—and failing to deliver—assistance in the form of subsidies. In spite of the recommendations and the promised subsidies, wheat prices continued to fall, and by October 1932 matters were becoming intense, with the farmers preparing to harvest the season's crop while simultaneously threatening to refuse to load the wheat.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Johnson2008-2">[2]</a></sup>
The difficulties facing farmers were increased by the arrival of as many as 20,000 emus.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-3">[3]</a></sup> Emus regularly migrate after their breeding season, heading to the coast from the inland regions. With the cleared land and additional water supplies being made available for livestock by the West Australian farmers, the emus found that the cultivated lands were good habitat, and they began to foray into farm territory—in particular the marginal farming land around Chandler and Walgoolan.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2">[2]</a></sup> The emus consumed and spoiled the crops, as well as leaving large gaps in fences where rabbits could enter and cause further problems.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-4">[4]</a></sup>
Farmers relayed their concerns about the birds ravaging their crops, and a deputation of ex-soldiers were sent to meet with the Minister of Defence, Sir George Pearce. Having served in World War I, the soldier-settlers were well aware of the effectiveness of machine guns, and they requested their deployment. The minister readily agreed, although with conditions attached: the guns were to be used by military personnel, and troop transport was to be financed by the Western Australian government, and the farmers would provide food, accommodation, and payment for the ammunition.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2">[2]</a></sup><sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-5">[5]</a></sup> Pearce also supported the deployment on the grounds that the birds would make good target practice,<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-6">[6]</a></sup> although it has also been argued that some in the government may have viewed this as a way of being seen to be helping the Western Australian farmers, and towards that end a Fox Movietone cinematographer was enlisted.<sup><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2">[2]</a></sup></p>
	<h2 id="the_war">The "War"</h2>
	<p>Military involvement was due to begin in October 1932.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-5”>[5]</a></sup> The "war" was conducted under the command of Major G.P.W. Meredith of the Seventh Heavy Battery of the Royal Australian Artillery,<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-6”>[6]</a></sup>  with Meredith commanding a pair of soldiers armed with two Lewis guns.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-8”>[8]</a></sup> and 10,000 rounds of ammunition.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-6”>[6]</a></sup>  The operation was delayed, however, by a period of rainfall that caused the emus to scatter over a wider area.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-5”>[5]</a></sup>  The rain ceased by 2 November 1932,<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup> <sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-5”>[5]</a></sup>  at which point the troops were deployed with orders to assist the farmers and, according to a newspaper account, to collect 100 emu skins so that their feathers could be used to make hats for light horsemen. .<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-9”>[9]</a></sup>
<h3>First attempt</h3>
On 2 November the men traveled to Campion, where some 50 emus were sighted.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup>  As the birds were out of range of the guns, the local settlers attempted to herd the emus into an ambush, but the birds split into small groups and ran so that they were difficult to target.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-6”>[6]</a></sup>  Nevertheless, while the first fusillade from the machine guns was ineffective due to the range, a second round of gunfire was able to kill "a number" of birds. Later the same day a small flock was encountered, and "perhaps a dozen" birds were killed.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup>
The next significant event was on 4 November. Meredith had established an ambush near a local dam, and more than 1,000 emus were spotted heading towards their position. This time the gunners waited until the birds were in close proximity before opening fire. The gun jammed after only twelve birds were killed, however, and the remainder scattered before more could be killed. No more birds were sighted that day.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup>
In the days that followed Meredith chose to move further south where the birds were "reported to be fairly tame",<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-10”>[10]</a></sup>  but there was only limited success in spite of his efforts.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup>  At one stage Meredith even went so far as to mount one of the guns on a truck: a move that proved to be ineffective, as the truck was unable to gain on the birds, and the ride was so rough that the gunner was unable to fire any shots.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup>  By 8 November, six days after the first engagement, 2,500 rounds of ammunition had been fired.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-6”>[6]</a></sup>  The number of birds killed is uncertain: one account claims just 50 birds,<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-6”>[6]</a></sup>  but other accounts range from 200 to 500—the latter figure being provided by the settlers. Meredith's official report noted that his men had suffered no casualties.<sup><a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emu_War#cite_note-Gill-2”>[2]</a></sup>
